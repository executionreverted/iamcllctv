Coming Soon Page – Design Document
Overview

Create a minimal, futuristic, and modern “Coming Soon” page.
The goal is to leave a strong visual impression while keeping the design extremely clean and simple. No images or heavy graphics — the wow factor comes from layout, typography, gradients, and subtle animations.

Structure
1. Header / Hero

Full viewport height.

Centered content (vertically & horizontally).

Main elements:

Title: “Coming Soon” or brand/project name.

Subtitle: Optional tagline (e.g., “Something amazing is on its way”).

Contact Email: Reveal or copy-on-click functionality:

Clicking email either opens mailto: or reveals the email address in a minimal animation (e.g., fade-in, slide, or text scramble).

Copy-to-clipboard feedback: “Email copied!” or similar subtle message.

2. Footer (optional)

Minimal: small text like copyright.

Can include social media links (if desired).

Design
Colors

Background: Dark gradient (e.g., deep purple → midnight blue) or futuristic gradient tones.

Text: Light, high-contrast (white or neon pastel).

Email link: Slight hover effect or glow to indicate interactivity.

Typography

Font: Sans-serif, clean, modern, futuristic.

Sizes:

Main title: Large, eye-catching.

Subtitle: Medium.

Email link: Legible, minimal.

Layout

Centered vertical/horizontal alignment.

Generous spacing.

Minimal lines, borders, or UI clutter.

Effects / Animations

Subtle hover effect on email (glow or underline slide).

Smooth fade-in for text on page load.

Optional: animated gradient background.

Email reveal/copy effect for extra wow factor.

Responsiveness

Fully responsive on mobile, tablet, and desktop.

Email link or reveal animation works on touch devices as well.

Notes

No contact form. Only a mailto link or reveal/copy email functionality.

No images or illustrations. Only text, gradient, and subtle animations.

Should feel futuristic but ultra-minimal.

Should immediately convey: “This is high-quality, modern, and sleek.”
